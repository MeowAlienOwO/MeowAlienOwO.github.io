Gintama is ended. I'm waiting for it's restart date.) 

I have now went to University of Edinburgh for postgraduate study, major in MSc Artificial Intelligence. After 1 Year of working in Shanghai, I've nearly totally forgot all the mathematic knowledge gathered both inside and outside the university which I spend on my undergraduate study. From now on I'll write blog for mathematic and ML related lecture note or related knowledge in this blog in English. Such blog have saved my study during undergraduate, hope this will work again in my postgraduate study.
